## Getting Started

1. install bun `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
  * may need to add to path? pay attention to what it says after you install and do what it says (or ask me)
2. clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:cjpais/llamascore.git`
3. `cd llamascore`
4. `bun i`
5. `bun dev`

no data will be there so.... ummm... i will figure this out later
